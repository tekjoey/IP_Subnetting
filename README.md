# IP_Subnetting

This is a single Python3 file for practicing IP address subnetting. It will generate a random IP address and subnet mask. Your task is to determine the Network, Broadcast, First host and Last host addresses.

Feel free to fork it for whatever legal purposes you desire.

You can run it locally on your machine if you have Python3, or use https://www.online-python.com/
